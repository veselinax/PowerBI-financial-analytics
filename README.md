# Power BI Financial Analytics

This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built using **Power BI**. The pipeline automates the process of extracting raw financial data from CSV files, performing necessary transformations (such as cleaning, processing, and formatting), and loading the transformed data into Power BI for analysis and reporting.

## Project Files

- **financial.pbix**: Complete Power BI file containing all data extraction, transformation, and visualization steps.
  
## Methods & Tools

- **Power BI**: The primary tool for extracting, transforming, and loading financial data.
- **CSV/Excel**: Data formats used for raw data before transformation.
- **DAX**: Power BI’s formula language used for creating measures and calculated columns.
- **Power Query**: Used within Power BI for transforming and cleaning data.

### Data Cleaning
The raw data was cleaned to ensure consistency. Issues such as missing values and duplicates were handled appropriately.

### Data Transformation
Various transformations were applied to the data, including:
- Handling categorical variables
- Aggregating and summarizing financial metrics
- Formatting the data into a structure suitable for visualization in Power BI

### Data Loading
The transformed data was loaded into **Power BI** for further analysis and visualization. 

## Key Findings

- **Financial Data Insights**: The project provides detailed insights into key financial metrics, such as revenue trends, profit margins, and expense breakdowns, which can be used to make data-driven business decisions.
  
- **Visualization of Key Metrics**: Interactive reports were created in Power BI to visualize financial performance, including:
  - **Revenue Trends**: Displays how revenue has changed over time.
  - **Profitability Analysis**: Visualizes profit margins and identifies areas where improvements can be made.
  - **Expense Breakdown**: Provides a detailed breakdown of business expenses to identify cost-saving opportunities.
  
- **Data Transformation for Clarity**: The raw financial data was cleaned and transformed, ensuring consistency across the dataset, allowing for accurate and reliable analysis in Power BI.
  
- **Scalability**: This project is easily scalable, allowing new financial data sources to be added or adjustments to be made to meet different reporting and analysis needs.
  
- **Improved Decision-Making**: By automating the ETL process and utilizing Power BI’s interactive reporting features, decision-makers can gain real-time access to financial data and make informed decisions quickly.
